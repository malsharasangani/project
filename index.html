    <h3 class="text-center"> Why Fashion?</h3>
    <p class="copy"> Fashion is something we deal with everyday.
        Even people who say they don’t care what they wear choose clothes
        every morning that say a lot about them and how they feel that day.
        One certain thing in the fashion world is change.
        We are constantly being bombarded with new fashion ideas from music,
        videos, books, and television. Movies also have a big impact on what people wear.

                <h4> Why you should love fashion? reason 1</h4>
                <p class="arranging">
                    The clothing we wear is often our most powerful and obvious form of
                    personal expression. What we choose to
                    wear tells everyone what type of person we are and what we think of ourself.

                <p class="arranging">
                    Fashion boosts the economy and creates jobs for a huge number of people,
                    from the designer who sketches the original concepts, to the outfitter who
                    manufactures the clothing, to the salesperson who sells the garment to us.

                <p class="arranging">
                    Whether I shop online, at a department store, small boutique or thrift store,
                    finding new clothes is fun.  I love welcoming new items into my wardrobe, wearing them,
                    and delighting in how they update everything else in my closet.

    <h3 class="text-center h">We have our own fashion design</h3>
    <p class="text-center">Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetics
        and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories.
        It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes,
        and has varied over time and place. Fashion designers
        work in a number of ways in designing clothing and accessories such
        as bracelets and necklaces. Because of the time required to bring a
        garment onto the market,
        designers must at times anticipate changes to consumer tastes.</p>
    <p class="text-center">
        Designers conduct research on fashion trends
        and interpret them for their audience. Their specific designs
        are used by manufacturers. This is the essence of a designer’s role;
        however, there is variation within this that is determined by
        the buying and merchandising approach, and product quality; for example,
        budget retailers will use inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends,
        but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used.[1]
